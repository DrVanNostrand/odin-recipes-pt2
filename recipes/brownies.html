        <h3>Recipe Description</h3>
            <p>These gooey brownies will absolutely melt your face off, full-stop.
                If you follow the recipe directions to a T, then you can make anyone 
                do your bidding by simply giving them a taste of these brownies. One
                taste and they'll be addicted forever. However, be forewarned. If the
                recipe is screwed up <em>at all</em>, then a portal to Hades itself will
                open before your feet and swallow you hole. This recipe also goes great
                with some chocolate frosting (recipe not included)!
            </p>
