        <h3>Recipe Description</h3>
            <p>These gooey brownies will absolutely melt your face off, full-stop.
                If you follow the recipe directions to a T, then you can make anyone 
                do your bidding by simply giving them a taste of these brownies. One
                taste and they'll be addicted forever. However, be forewarned. If the
                recipe is screwed up <em>at all</em>, then a portal to Hades itself will
                open before your feet and swallow you hole. This recipe also goes great
                with some chocolate frosting (recipe not included)!
            </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup butter, melted</li>
                <li>3 cups white sugar</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>4 eggs</li>
                <li>1 & 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 
                    9x13 baking dish.</li>
                <li>Combine the melted butter, sugar, and vanilla in a large bowl.
                    Beat in the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each, 
                    until thoroughly blended.</li>
                <li>Sift the flour, cocoa powder, and salt in a bowl. Gradually stir
                    flour mixture into the egg mixture until blended. Stir in the chocolate
                    morsels. Spread the batter evenly into the prepared baking dish.</li>
                <li>Bake in preheated oven until an inserted toothpick comes out clean,
                    35 to 40 minutes. Remove and cool pan on wire rack before cutting.</li>
            </ol>
