        <h3>Recipe Description</h3>
            <p>Now here's recipe from the great man himself: Santa Claus! I was
                cross-country skiing across the north pole one day when I heard a great
                chortling in the distance. The sound of sleigh bells soon followed, and
                before I knew it the man in red and his hooved entourage were hovering above me.
                He didn't speak a word, just winked and dropped a single piece of parchment to
                the ground. I picked it up and it was this delicious Christmas cookie recipe!
            </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>3 & 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 & 1/2 cups white sugar</li>
                <li>1 cup margarine, softened</li>
                <li>2 eggs</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Sift together flour, baking power, and salt in a medium bowl; set aside.</li>
                <li>Beat sugar and margarine in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs
                    one at a time, then stir in vanilla. Gradually blend in dry ingredients until
                    incorporated. Wrap dough; chill in refrigerator for 2 hours.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease two cookies sheets.</li>
                <li>Roll out dough on a clean floured surface to 1/4-inch thickness. Cut out shapes
                    using cookie cutters; arrange them on the prepared cookie sheets. Gather scraps
                    and repeat this step.</li>
                <li>Bake in batches in the preheated oven until edges are barely brown, 6 to 8 minutes.
                    Carefully transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool.</li>
            </ol>
